Then put in olive oil (enough to coat) and salt and pepper. Add in the other spices as well now(about 1 tbl spoon each), and the whole gloves of garlic (unpeeled). Add in the juice from one orange and mix it all around so that each piece of meat is covered. Spread everything around so it's evenly dispersed, you don't want all the garlic or bay leaves in one place. \n\nPlace in the oven at 135C for 3 1/2 hours, then it should be fork tender when you take it out. A nice extra step is to take off the tin foil and place the meat under the broiler set to high to get it crispy. "}}},pathContext:{id:"c1ebQaqdNVYcgEwaWIIY4Oa"}}}});
